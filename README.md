# KaggleSantander
Only for my interest

This kaggle competition is [Santander Customer Satisfaction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-satisfaction). [Santander Bank](https://www.santanderbank.com/us/personal) is asking Kagglers to help them identify dissatisfied customers early in their relationship.

##Problems
1. The main issue of this competition is the distribution of __TARGET__ is very imbalanced. The dissatisfied customers is only 5 percent. If we train a model just using accuracy as the evalutation, a very bad model can even achieve 95% of accuracy. 
2. A very small amount of missing values. Maybe this is related to *__dissatisfied customer__*. 
3. The training dataset has 374 variables. We should do some work of __feature engineering__.
